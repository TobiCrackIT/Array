# Array

Array in solidity can be used to store multiple values of the same type.
Array can have a compile-time fixed size or a dynamic size.
We will write code to do different operations on array like adding, removing, getting length, getting value at index, getting whole array, etc.

## Initilaize an array

There are several ways to initialize an array.

Let's write the first one.
Here, we are just declaring an array named arr and not initializing it with values.

```
    uint[] public arr;
```

Let's write an array and initialize it with values.

```
    uint[] public arr2 = [1, 2, 3];
```

Now, we will write an array with fixed size.
In this case, it will be initialized with zeros by default.

```
    uint[10] public myFixedSizeArr;
```

## Getting an element from an array

Let's write a function to get an element from an array.
Here we are just indexing the array using the index passed through the parameter.

```
    function get(uint i) public view returns (uint) {
        return arr[i];
    }
```

## Append an element to an array

Now we will write a function to append an element to an array.
This will increase the array length by 1.

```
    function push(uint i) public {
        arr.push(i);
    }
```

We are using the `push` function to append an element to an array.
It appends the element at the end of the array.

## Pop an element from an array

Let's write a function to remove an element from an array.
This will decrease the array length by 1.

```
    function pop() public {
        arr.pop();
    }
```

We are using the `pop` function to remove an element from an array.
It removes the last element from the array.

## Remove an element from an array

Now we will write a function to remove an element from an array without changing the array length.

```
    function remove(uint index) public {
        delete arr[index];
    }
```

Here we are using the `delete` function to remove an element from an array.
It does not change the array length.
It resets the value at index to it's default value, in this case 0.

## Get the length of an array

Now we will write a function to get the length of an array.

```
    function getLength() public view returns (uint) {
        return arr.length;
    }
```

`arr.length` gives the length of the array.

## Retrieving the entire array

Solidity provides a way to retrieve the entire array.
But it is not recommended to use it for arrays that can grow indefinitely in length.

```
    function getArr() public view returns (uint[] memory) {
        return arr;
    }
```

## Removing an element without a gap in the array

Deleting an element from an array creates a gap in the array.
One trick to keep the array compact is to move the last element into the place to delete.

```
    function removeCompact(uint index) public {
        // Move the last element into the place to delete
        arr[index] = arr[arr.length - 1];
        // Remove the last element
        arr.pop();
    }
```
